              Hi! I am the developer of this website and the founder of
              GoCareering. I am 15 years old and a 10th grade student at Green
              Hills Academy. I started GoCareering for my personal project
              assignment that I have been working on since grade 9. I got the
              idea when I was discussing with my father what I wanted to be in
              the future and I hadn't made my decision yet and neither did I
              have much information about the variety of the careers. So, we got
              the idea of carrying out different interviews with different
              career specialists and recording them so that we can also provide
              it to other highschool students who are in my situation. I started
              to contact the people I knew and interviewed them and made my
              interviews public as planned. I really hope you gain as much
              information as possible and I wish you a happy careering!
            </p>
